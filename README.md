# Shoal margin collapses
Associated to the paper called: Effect of perturbations by shoal margin collapses on the morphodynamics of a sandy estuary, Journal of Geophysical Research - Earth Surface. 

This resporatory contains the Matlab-code that was build to simulate shoal margin collapses in a numerical morphodynamics model (Delft3D) simulation. 
Some code lines are associated to Delft3D matlab codes, which should be installed in advance.

Included in this repository are the matlab-script to run the Delft3D (with stopping for adding shoal margin collapses,
matlab-script that adds shoal margin collapses to the bed elevation (incl. eroded scar and associated deposit) based on analysis of the Western Scheldt by Van Dijk et al., 2017 Location and probability of shoal margin collapses in a sandy estuary, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (doi:\10.1002/esp.4395).
Median bed elevation for the Western Scheldt (used to determine shoal margins)
Shapefile of the Region of Interest.

Initial model setup is not applied for the Western Scheldt, but was provided by Deltares and Rijkswterstaat.
