# Shoal margin collapses
Associated to the paper called: Effect of perturbations by shoal margin collapses on the morphodynamics of a sandy estuary. 

This resporatory contains the Matlab-code that was build to simulate shoal margin collapses in a numerical morphodynamics model (Delft3D) simulation. 
Some code lines are associated to Delft3D matlab codes, which should be installed in advance.
